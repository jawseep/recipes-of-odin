    <h1>Chicken Pork Adobo</h1>
    <img src="../images/cpa.jpg">
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Chicken pork adobo is a beloved Filipino dish that embodies the essence 
        of comfort food. It features a richly flavored marinade of vinegar, soy 
        sauce, garlic, and spices, which tenderizes the meat while infusing it 
        with a tangy and savory taste. Typically, a combination of chicken pieces 
        and pork belly or shoulder is simmered slowly in this marinade until the 
        meats are tender and infused with the robust flavors of the sauce. The 
        dish is known for its versatility, as variations in ingredients and 
        cooking techniques allow for regional and personal adaptations throughout 
        the Philippines.</p>
    <p>Each bite of chicken pork adobo offers a delightful contrast of textures, 
        with the meat being both succulent and lightly caramelized from the 
        reduction of the marinade. It's often served with steamed rice to soak 
        up the flavorful sauce, which has a perfect balance of acidity and 
        umami. </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>500g chicken pieces (thighs, drumsticks, or a combination)</li>
        <li>500g pork belly or shoulder, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 head of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup vinegar (preferably cane vinegar or white vinegar)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance the acidity)</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate the meats:</strong> In a bowl or a large resealable 
            bag, combine the chicken and pork with soy sauce, minced garlic, bay 
            leaf, whole black peppercorns, and vinegar. Mix well to coat the meat 
            evenly. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour, or even 
            overnight in the refrigerator for deeper flavor.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the garlic:</strong> Heat a large pan or pot over medium 
            heat. Add a tablespoon of cooking oil and sauté the minced garlic 
            until fragrant and lightly golden. Be careful not to burn the garlic 
            as it can turn bitter.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook the meats:</strong> Add the marinated chicken and pork 
            (reserve the marinade) to the pan with the sautéed garlic. Brown the 
            meats on all sides for about 5-7 minutes.
        </li>    
        <li><strong>Simmer with marinade:</strong> Pour in the marinade mixture 
            (soy sauce, vinegar, spices) into the pan. Add water enough to cover 
            the meats. Bring to a boil then lower the heat to a simmer.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook until tender:</strong>Cover the pan and let it simmer 
            for about 30-40 minutes or until the meats are tender and cooked 
            through. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking and to prevent 
            sticking.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Adjust seasoning:</strong> Taste the adobo and adjust 
            seasoning with salt and sugar if desired, to balance the flavors.
        </li>
        <li>Once the meats are tender and the sauce has reduced to your liking 
            (it should be slightly thickened), remove from heat. Serve hot with 
            steamed rice.
        </li>
        <p>This version of chicken pork adobo highlights the robust flavors of 
            garlic, creating a deliciously savory dish that pairs perfectly with 
            rice. Enjoy your meal!</p>
