    <img src="../images/tapsilog.jpeg">
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Tapsilog is a beloved Filipino breakfast dish that harmoniously blends 
        savory flavors and textures. At its heart is tender slices of beef, 
        marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and sugar to create 
        tapa, which is then pan-fried to caramelized perfection. This flavorful 
        beef is served alongside sinangag, garlic-fried rice that boasts a 
        tantalizing aroma and a satisfying crunch. </p>
    <p>Completing the trio is a sunny-side-up fried egg, with its rich, golden 
        yolk adding a luxurious touch to the dish. Tapsilog captures the essence 
        of Filipino comfort food, offering a hearty start to the day that's 
        both filling and deeply satisfying.</p>
