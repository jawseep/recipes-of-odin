    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Sinigang na baka is a classic Filipino soup known for its savory and 
        tangy broth infused with tamarind. Tender chunks of beef simmered with 
        a medley of vegetables such as radish, eggplant, and green beans create 
        a hearty and flavorful dish. Its distinctive sourness, balanced by a 
        hint of sweetness, makes it a beloved comfort food enjoyed across the 
        Philippines. Best served piping hot with steamed rice, it offers a 
        delightful blend of flavors that capture the essence of Filipino culinary 
        tradition.</p>
    <p>Sautéeing in onion, garlic, fish sauce, and tomato, offers 
        a robust twist on the traditional Filipino soup. The beef is cooked to 
        tender perfection in a savory broth infused with the tang of tamarind, 
        balanced by the sweetness of tomatoes. This flavorful rendition combines 
        rich umami notes with the classic sourness of sinigang, creating a hearty 
        and satisfying dish that pairs wonderfully with steamed rice.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>500g beef (preferably ribs or shank), cut into serving pieces</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, quartered</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>2 cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 thumb-sized piece of ginger, sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium daikon radish (labanos), peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium eggplant, sliced</li>
        <li>1 bunch kangkong (water spinach) or other leafy greens</li>
        <li>2-3 pieces green chili peppers (siling haba), optional</li>
        <li>1 packet (about 40g) sinigang mix or tamarind paste</li>
        <li>Fish sauce and salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, heat some cooking oil over medium heat. Sauté 
            the onion, garlic, and tomatoes until softened and aromatic.
            Add 2 tablespoon of fish sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the beef pieces and cook until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Pour enough water to cover the meat (about 8-10 cups). Bring to a 
            boil, then lower the heat to simmer. Cover and cook until the beef 
            is tender, about 1.5 to 2 hours. Skim off any scum that rises to the 
            surface.</li>
        <li>Once the beef is tender, add the sinigang mix and stir to dissolve. 
            Adjust the sourness according to your preference by adding more 
            sinigang mix or tamarind paste.</li>
        <li>Add the daikon radish and simmer for about 5-10 minutes until 
            slightly softened.</li>
        <li>Add the eggplant and cook for another 5 minutes or until tender.</li>
        <li>Add the kangkong (or other leafy greens) and green chili peppers 
            (if using). Cook for a few more minutes until the greens are wilted.</li>
        <li>Season with fish sauce or salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with steamed rice. Enjoy your sinigang na baka!</li>
    </ol>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can adjust the amount of water depending on 
        how soupy you want your sinigang to be. Some people prefer it more brothy, 
        while others prefer it thicker. Adjust the cooking time as needed to ensure 
        the beef is tender.</p>
